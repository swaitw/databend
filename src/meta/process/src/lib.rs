//! Process metadata for upgrading purpose.
//!
//! [`examples::upgrade_09`] loads metadata from a `raft-dir` and upgrade TableMeta to new version and write them back.
//! Both in raft-log data and in state-machine data will be converted.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//! - Shut down all databend-meta processes.
//!
//! - Backup before proceeding: https://docs.databend.com/guides/deploy/upgrade/backup-and-restore-schema
//!
//! - To view the current TableMeta version, print all TableMeta records with the following command:
//!   It should display a list of TableMeta record.
//!   You need to upgrade only if there is a `ver` that is lower than 24.
//!
//!    ```text
//!    $0 --cmd print --raft-dir "<./your/raft-dir/>"
//!    # output:
//!    # TableMeta { ver: 23, ..
//!    ```
//!
//! - Run it:
//!
//!   ```text
//!   $0 --cmd upgrade --raft-dir "<./your/raft-dir/>"
//!   ```
//!
//! - To assert upgrade has finished successfully, print all TableMeta records that are found in meta dir with the following command:
//!   It should display a list of TableMeta record with a `ver` that is greater or equal 24.
//!
//!    ```text
//!    $0 --cmd print --raft-dir "<./your/raft-dir/>"
//!    # output:
//!    # TableMeta { ver: 25, ..
//!    # TableMeta { ver: 25, ..
//!    ```
