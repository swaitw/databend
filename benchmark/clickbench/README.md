This directory contains subdirectories dedicated to various performance tests, 

specifically for TPCH tests, Hits tests, and internal query performance tests. Below is a brief overview of each subdirectory:

## 1. tpch

This subdirectory includes performance evaluation tools and scripts related to TPCH tests. 

TPCH tests are designed to simulate complex query scenarios to assess the system's performance when handling large datasets. In this directory, you can find testing scripts, configuration files, and documentation for test results.

## 2. hits

Hits tests focus on specific queries or operations for performance testing. 

In this subdirectory, you'll find scripts for Hits tests, sample queries, and performance analysis tools.

## 3. internal
